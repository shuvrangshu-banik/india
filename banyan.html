<p align="center"><font size="5">Ficus benghalensis, or Ficus indica commonly known as the banyan, banyan fig and Indian banyan,it is a tree native to the Indian Subcontinent. Specimens in India are among the largest trees in the world by canopy coverage. It is also known as a "strangler fig" because like many other trees in the genus Ficus it starts out as epiphyte, that is, leaning on another tree that it ends up suffocating.</font></p>
